# Comparison-and-Review-of-Pose-Estimation-Implementations

People detection has long been a popular issue in
traditional object detection for a spectrum of uses. Computers
can now interpret human body language by performing stance
recognition and pose tracking thanks to recent advances
in machine-learning techniques. The precision of these
detections, as well as the technology needs to execute them,
have now reached a commercially viable level.
Furthermore, the technologyâ€™s development is being deeply
influenced by the coronavirus pandemic, where high performance real-time posture detection and tracking will
usher in some of the most impactful advances in computer
vision. 

Combining human position estimation and distance
projection algorithms, for example, can be used for social
distancing. In a busy environment, it helps people maintain
physical space from one another.
When we analyze how pose estimate may be used to
automatically detect human movement, we can see how
powerful it is. 

Pose estimation has the potential to develop
a new wave of automated systems meant to quantify the
precision of human movement, from virtual sports coaches
and AI-powered personal trainers to tracking movements on
factory floors to ensure worker safety. Autonomous driving is
one area where this technology has already proven its worth.
Computers can identify and predict pedestrian behavior more
accurately with the use of real-time human pose detection
and tracking, allowing for more consistent driving

Moreover, the experiment compares and contrasts the BlazePose and MoveNet frameworks in the tackling of the Pose Estimation problem.
